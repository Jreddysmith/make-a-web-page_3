		<div class="description_repeat">
			<p>Try to avoid repetition, focus more on putting all the containers and divs, for every element on the page. like the headings, I did all of this withought putting any content in the page. Once I created the entire HTML structure, I start writing the CSS for the different class and parts of the page. While feeling in the content I started seeing what I wanted to put in my page and how I wanted to structure it. When feeling in the tree like structure first and elements on your page. Then writing your structure is easier to avoid unnecessary repetition in the code. Now I can go back and change what I want in the page easier by changing a few things in CSS or HTML.

		<div class="lastscript">
			<p>In session 2, we start looking more into structure in are code and CSS. As in how to style it and look good, but to also use the code in the proper way. With the right divs and spans. Writing code in a uniform manner will help you down the road and make any mistakes easier to fix. Unless you have <span style="background-color:#008000">Jarvis</span>, then it would be easy.
